### What is it?

The Learning Lab is a new initiative from the CS Department to provide accessible and collaborative assistance on understanding key concepts from introductory CS courses, including: 110, 283, 290, 380, 401, 410, and 411. We are excited to offer this resource in addition to the traditional Office Hours and recitations that already occur!

### What kind of help can I get?
The Learning Lab is designed to be your one-stop shop for conceptual help. A typical Learning Lab session will involve a group of TAs discussing material from lecture and answering questions in a small group session. We won't offer help on any assignments or labs, but it is a great place to reinforce your understanding of material and work with other students in a smaller setting.
